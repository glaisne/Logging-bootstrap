## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains a **mini-architecture** built with **Terraform 1.x** for Microsoft Azure.  
It serves both as:

1. A **working sample** you can deploy in minutes, and  
2. A **portfolio artifact** that demonstrates clean, production-minded Infrastructure-as-Code.

### Key features

- Remote backend (Azure Blob) with state locking  
- CI pipeline: `fmt → validate → tflint → tfsec → infracost`  
- Modular Terraform structure ready for reuse  
- Auto-generated architecture diagram & docs site (GitHub Pages)
